# Typer-house28
This project is a collaborative effort involving contributors from various backgrounds, locations, and skill levels. The main goal is to build a feature-rich typing test platform that not only allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy but also provides insightful analysis about their performance.

The platform helps users understand their typing standard by comparing results with other users. It includes multiple stages of development, each focusing on enhancing user experience, performance tracking, and social interaction through challenges or leaderboards.

This project is a great example of teamwork across diverse skill sets and regions, bringing together ideas and experiences to create a powerful and user-friendly tool for typists of all levels.
